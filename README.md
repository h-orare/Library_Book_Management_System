It reads books data from a CSV file and loads into a books array as objects. The programn also reads a CSV file containing strudent details and loads the data into student array Through a menu, a user can select menu options(1. List All Books 2. List All Students 3. Borrow A book, 4. Return a Book, 5. Show Borrowed Books 6. Exit) Each menu option calls approriate functions and executes the actions
